    reg domain results with 'global'; we must not let that trip up tests when
    they are run on Ubuntu infrastructure vs. local tests.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * doc/example-config: Adjust "routes:" example.
    It does not make sense to make "routes:" a global thing, they should be
    tied to an interface so that the route is only set when the corresponding
    interface exists and is up, and the config is not split in two parts.
  * doc/netplan.md: Point out that NM does not support globbing (LP: #1631018)

  [ Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre ]
  * Fix coverage for src/netplan to be 100%, and fail if coverage falls below
    that mark again.
  * Add support for specifying routes.

  * tests/integration.py: Clean up wpa_supplicant in between tests

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 30 Aug 2016 07:21:02 +0200

nplan (0.11) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * Support /lib/netplan/*.yaml files.
    This is useful for configuration snippets shipped by packages.
  * Add networkd support for wifi (LP: #1616928)
    networkd cannot handle wifi natively, so generate a wpa_supplicant
    configuration and unit that does the WLAN part and leave the IP part to
    networkd.
    This supports open and WPA2, and infrastructure and adhoc mode. "match:" is not
    supported as the netplan-wpa@.service helper unit is bound to the named network
    interface device unit.
  * As networkd can now handle wifi devices, use networkd consistently as a default
    renderer.
  * tests/integration.py: Kill leftover NetworkManager processes between tests.
    NetworkManager.service has KillMode=process and leaks dhclient processes.
  * Fix package description for updated yaml paths

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 29 Aug 2016 17:25:33 +0200

nplan (0.10) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * Add "netplan ifupdown-migrate" command.
    This supports converting "loopback" (no-op) and "dhcp" interfaces (without
    options) for now.
  * Add "dhcp6:" option
  * Add "gateway[46]:" options
  * Ship empty /etc/netplan in the package
  * NM: Explicitly disable implied DHCP default when DHCP is not enabled.
    (LP: #1617051)
  * tests/integration.py: Quiesce systemd-networkd-wait-online.
  * Add support for VLAN.

nplan (0.9) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * tests/integration.py: Improve debug messages on failure
  * netplan apply: disconnect devices from NetworkManager before restarting.
    Merely restarting NetworkManager does not suffice to apply a changed
    configuration, so disconnect managed devices first.
    Add autopkgtest to reproduce the problem and confirm the fix.
  * Fix configuration path in package description
  * networkd: Change generated config file prefix to "10-netplan"
    Just "netplan-*" sorts after /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link.
  * netplan apply: Force-replug network devices which are down to apply renames.
    Unbind/rebind network devices from their driver to simulate a hotplug, so
    that device renames get applied. Don't do this for devices which are up
    (or "unknown") though, to avoid disrupting existing network connections.
  * tests/integration.py: Add workaround for NM "unmanaged-devices="
    mishandling (LP #1615044)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 19 Aug 2016 19:10:33 +0200

nplan (0.8) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * tests/cli.py: Test "generate" more precisely
  * Let "make coverage" fail if coverage is < 100%
  * Support /run/netplan/*.yaml files.
    This is useful if you want to try out a new network config before
    "committing" it to /etc: if your remote server is still reachable after
    "apply", you copy the files to /etc; otherwise rebooting will go back to
    the known-good state.
  * If global renderer is set to NM, allow NM to manage all devices.
    By default, NetworkManager only manages wifi and wwan devices (via
    /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf). If
    global renderer is set to NetworkManager, disable that file in /run so
    that NM will once again manage all devices. This should be configured on
    desktop systems.
  * netplan apply: Asynchronously restart networkd/NM.
    This avoids deadlocks when calling "apply" during the boot sequence.

  * Prefer pycodestyle over pep8

  * tests/integration.py: Use systemd-networkd-wait-online instead of polling
  * netplan.5: Add missing NAME section
